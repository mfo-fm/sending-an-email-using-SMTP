# sending-an-email-using-SMTP
A Python code that sends an email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

This script sends an email with a subject line that includes the current date. It logs in to the Gmail SMTP server using SSL, creates an email message with a text body, and sends it to a specified recipient. If any errors occur during this process, they are caught and printed to the console.
